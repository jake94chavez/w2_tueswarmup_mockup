Title: Whiteboard ~Wednesday~ Thursday <br>
Type: Morning Exercise<br>
Duration: "0:45"<br>
Creator: Alex White<br>
Competencies: Problem Solving, Pseudo Code <br>
---

## Directions:
- Close your computers and find a partner
- Read through the first challenge and spend a couple of minutes brainstorming individually before you collaborate. 
- When both of you have had a little time to think, find some whiteboard space
- Brainstorm together, draw diagrams, talk out the problem
- Create examples to work through
- Break down the problem into small, manageable pieces
- Write Pseudo Code to solve the problem, tackling the easiest parts first
- When you have a solution, think about **edge cases**
- If you get that far, do the same with challenge 2!
- We will have one group share their solution to each problem! 

:coffee: **Edge Case** definition: 

An edge case is a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter. For example, a stereo speaker might noticeably distort audio when played at its maximum rated volume, even in the absence of other extreme settings or conditions. An edge case can be expected or unexpected. *-Wikipedia*

For example, if we have had a challenge to find all of the prime numbers under some number *n*, the edge cases would be when *n* is 0, negative, when there are no prime's under *n*, etc. 


## The Challenges
1. Write an algorith that reverses a string. 
Example: `"spoons"`
`// snoops`

	Bonus: Write another algorithm that uses the algorithm you just wrote to check if a string is a [palindrome](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=palindrome+meaning)
1. Write an algorithm that takes an **array of integers** and returns the value of the most frequent integer. 
Example: `[3, 78, 111, 404, 111, 98, 3, 111]`
`// 111`
