1) What can I do to add some margins around the paragraph about our client?
1) How can I change the size of the picture of the cat?

## Create This Mockup
 ![Mockup](https://i.imgur.com/XLnBkER.png)
- Using what you learned about CSS, style the HTML lab so it looks like the mockup.

## Getting Started
1) You already created the HTML for this mockup yesterday. You should have created it in your `w01d04/morning_exercise` folder. We called it `index.html`. You will start there. 

## Stretch:

1. Create/style the About page mentioned in the Stretch section of the HTML lab.
2. Fix the margins, font, layout, etc. to make this site look more modern and professional!
3. Get creative! Make this the most beautiful grumpy cat site the world has ever seen! I'm sure he will still hate it, but everyone else will love it!
