## Part 1: Speedcoder and typing.io
Spend 10 minutes each on each of the following typing for coder lessons! This will help you get faster at typing special characters you aren't used to using, AND help you get familiar with syntax. Set a timer!

**note** Do NOT attempt to understand all of the code you are typing! That will come much later. For now just get used to typing the syntax and work on your speed.

And [this lesson on JavaScript from Typing.io](https://typing.io/lesson/javascript/jquery/traversing.js/1) 

  For this lesson, what you are practicing on is actually the open source jQuery Library! We will be learning how to use jQuery next week!
